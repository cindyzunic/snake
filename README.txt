SNAKE
Xinxin Xie - x22xie

Game Description
--------------------
Use the arrow keys or the a, w, d, s keys to move the snake. Eating a red fruit grows the snake and gains 10 points. Eating a power up superfood (cyan) gains an extra 50 points without growing the snake. Eating a purple potion resets the length of the snake to its initial length. Running into walls (bounds of the game window) or running into the snake itself ends the game.

Hitting the p key toggles between pause and play. Hitting the r key at any time restarts the game.

Enhancements
----------------
Cyan superfood items appear at a random location on the screen every time the snake eats five normal (red) fruits.

Purple potions appear at a random location on the screen every time the snake eats 15 normal fruits.
